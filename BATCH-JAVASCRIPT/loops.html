<h4>Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.</h4>
<script>
    // For loop: repeats a block of code a specific number of times
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log("For loop iteration:", i);
    }

    // While loop: repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true
    let count = 0;
    while (count < 3) {
        console.log("While loop iteration:", count);
        count++; // Increment count to eventually make the condition false
    }

    // Looping through an Array
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
    for (let j = 0; j < fruits.length; j++) {
        console.log("Fruit:", fruits[j]);
    }

    // For...of loop (modern way to iterate over iterable objects like arrays)
    for (const fruit of fruits) {
        console.log("Fruit (for...of):", fruit);
    }
